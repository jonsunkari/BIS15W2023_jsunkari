## Seating & Set-up
1. Please make sure that you sit next to your group members for the rest of the quarter.
2. Please set-up your computer as normal.

## Warm-up
For this warm-up, please use the `heartrate` data. Be sure to label your plots!

1. Make a plot that compares the heartrate of patients for drug a.
```{r}
heartrate <- read_csv("data/heartrate.csv")

heartrate %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=patient, y=a))+geom_col()+labs(title="Effects of Drug A on Patients' Heart Rate", x="Patient", y="Heart Rate")
```


2. Make a plot that compares heartrate (as a range) for each drug.
```{r}
heartrate %>%
  pivot_longer(-patient, names_to = "drug", values_to = "heartrate") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=drug, y=heartrate))+geom_boxplot()
```
