3. Done

4. 
```{r}
+ 5 - 3 * 2
```

```{r}
+ 8 / 2 ** 2
```

5. I was not surprised by the results, because I am aware that R does calculations by order of operations. 
```{r}
(+ 5 - 3) * 2
```

```{r}
(+ 8 / 2) ** 2
```

6. 
```{r}
pi <- 3.14159265359
```

7. 
```{r}
pi * 2
```

8.
```{r}
?mean
```

9. 
```{r}
x <- c(2, 8, 6, 6, 7, 4, 9, 9, 9, 10)

```
```{r}
mean(x)
```

10.
```{r}
median(x)
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
