## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

It typically requires a bachelor's degree. Job growth is 36% which is faster than average. 

2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

Skills primarily consist of loading and analyzing various data types, especially csv dataframes, in R. Analysis skills include tidying and summarizing data, organizing it (grouping by variable) by summary and plots, and finally, allowing a user to explore the data through shinyapp. 

3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

Currently, I am interested in pursuing an MD or DO degree. If I choose to do research as a part of that journey, R could help in the analysis of my data. I also want to get a brief job in tech or web development. My Shiny skills would help for the latter, allowing me to interface with the user. And in general, the skills I've learned to tidy and analyze data via summary, count, etc., will definitely help me in getting some kind of tech/data analysis job. 

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

Most difficult: figuring out how to approach a problem, especially those that relate to pivoting. 
Most rewarding: figuring out the problem, seeing all the skills culminate in building a shinyapp


5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

I wish I had known more about tidying data, and pivoting. 

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

I'd want to learn more about modeling; i.e, imitating biological processes with modeling, and see if those models could be predictive. 

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

Yes, I want to learn Javascript, React, etc., and continue to learn more R skills. 

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

Not super important, I felt most of the work I did was on my own except for some on the midterms. I don't think much would change if the class were an online format, other than the midterms would be more difficult and it may be harder to get questions answered. 

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.

Yes
